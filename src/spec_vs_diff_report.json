  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all three requirements. REQ-1 is implemented with a new OrderDetails page showing comprehensive order information with gradient styling. REQ-2 is implemented with navigation from OrderConfirmation to OrderDetails. REQ-3 is implemented with accordion-based expandable order details in AdminOrders and navigation to the full details page. However, some requested fields (date, status, shipping address details) are missing from the implementation.",
