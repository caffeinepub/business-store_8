# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add instructional content to the admin products page to guide users through the product upload process.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an informational section to the AdminProducts page explaining the product upload workflow
- Include step-by-step instructions covering: clicking 'Add Product', filling the form fields, selecting an image (max 5MB), and saving
- Style the instructions consistently with the existing warm earth tone design theme

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can view clear, on-page instructions explaining how to upload products, including all required steps and the image size limit.
