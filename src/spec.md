# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add order details view accessible to both customers and admins.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a user-facing order details page showing order ID, date, status, shipping information, ordered items with quantities and prices, and total amount
- Add navigation from the order confirmation page to view order details
- Make orders in the admin orders page clickable to view full order details in an expanded view or modal
- Style all new components with the existing OM FANCY blue-cyan gradient theme and Space Grotesk typography

**User-visible outcome:** Customers can view comprehensive details of their completed orders from the confirmation page, and admins can click any order in the admin panel to see full order information including shipping details and itemized products.
